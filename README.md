# NAPC-Classic

> NAPC - Stand for 'Not A Pvp Client'. It is a gray area between PvP Client and Hacks

WARNING [DON'T USE IT ON HYPIXEL]

NAPC is technically a mod pack that has mods, resource packs, and macros that might give you a slight advantage over other players while not getting detected.

I did not make any of the mod/resource packs here, I just put compatible mods together to create this client.
I will put a link to the website of the mods. As well as a credit of the section that will credit all the Authors and the website to the mod/resource packs.(When I finished upload all files on to github)

##  Installation
### Windows:  

Click on the green 'Code' button ► Download ZIP  
Extract the 'windows' folder  
In the launcher, set the game directory to the folder you just extracted.  
Find and launch the Minecraft version 'NAPC'

###  Linux:  
Click on the green 'Code' button ► Download ZIP  
Extract the 'Linux' folder  
In the launcher, set the game directory to the version that you want to install:  
``` With Scroll-To-Click mod version or Without Scroll-To-Click mod version. ```  
Find and launch the Minecraft version 'NAPC'  
```(Note that if you are using the Linux ►Scroll-to-Click-Macro version does not have the cosmetic, since the Essential Mod cannot load with the No Scroll. The mod that prevents hot bar scrolling when you  are using scroll-to-click)```  

## How to enable/disable mods

NAPC is a modpack, so there is 2 ways to disable mods.  
  
For mods that support being disabled in-game, click on the 'Mods' button in the pause menu. It will bring you to the mod menu, choose the mod you want to disable from the list. And click on the red 'Disable' button to disable it.  
  
For mods that Do Not support being disabled(The 'The disable button to grey out in the mod menu'), go to the 'mods' folder in the client-folder. Move the mod .jar file that you want to disable into the '! Disabled' folder. And restart the game.

### Cosmetics
``` The Cosmetics are provided by the Essential Mod, and there are many great free cosmetics for you to choose from. However, if you want to spend money and buy cosmetics, you are 100% welcome to do so. Just keep in mind that 100% of the money that you use to buy those cosmetics goes to the Essential Mod developers. It is great if you want to support their amazing work. Just remember that this is just a hobby project, and it is NOT sponsored by the Essential Mod. ```

The cosmetics (only available in Windows and Linux ► Non-Scroll-to-click macro version only) Work just like the other clients. You can buy cosmetics from the store and wear them. and other people using NAPC or the Essential mod can see it.

To use it, get into a world, and press the escape key to get to the pause menu. Now press on the 'Cosmetics' button and it will take you to the cosmetics page

### Key-Stroakes

The key-Strokes mod allows you to see the key that you are pressing, your fps, and your cps.
If you are making a video, it helps the viewers see how you play and hopefully learn from it. 

To use it, type ``` /keystrokes ```  in the chat, and a menu will show up. Letting you customise the keystrokes.

## Todo 
1. make no scroll mod mod compatable with essental so that I can merge the with-macro and without-macro version together
2. Fix the extreamly long loading time when redirecting budgie network servers when running on Linux
3. Make fps faster
4. add in ingame music player (maybe)
5. add a batch/shell script or gui application to automaticly disable/enable mods
6. add credit section
